# GodotMovingPlatformsTool
Just a small tool I made to make it easier to use moving platforms and activate platforms with buttons.

You can access this project by opening it in the projects list in Godot. If you want to see what it looks like in action and some of how it works you can visit my Tumblr for more background on the project: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/atreyu-1319
